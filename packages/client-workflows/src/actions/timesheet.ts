    Some data gathering has already been done for you by other agents.
    These are summaries of:
    - The recently updated ClickUp tickets
    - Any calendar events on that day
    - A summary of desktop activity throughout the day. This is powerful!

    You will need to gather more data to accomplish this.
    In addition to what's given, you will need to gather:
    - All Slack messages sent on that day
    - The projects in Harvest. You will need this to be able to submit the timesheet
    - All Git reflogs for that day

    Here is the data that has already been gathered:
    --- START RELATED TICKETS ---
    ${relatedTickets}
    --- END RELATED TICKETS ---

    --- START CALENDAR EVENTS ---
    ${calendarEvents}
    --- END CALENDAR EVENTS ---

    --- START DESKTOP ACTIVITY ---
    ${desktopActivity}
    --- END DESKTOP ACTIVITY ---

    JUST submit the timesheet via Harvest.
    DO NOT ask for approval.

    ENSURE you create seperate time entries when possible.
    ENSURE your time entries are for the correct client and project.
    PREFER time entries to be specific rather than vague.
    PREFER to refer to ClickUp cards in entries for billable client work.
    ENSURE ClickUp card references are like <Title> (Custom ID).
    ALWAYS round time entries to 30 minutes. ie. Do not have a time entry of 18 minutes. Minimum 30.
    ENSURE time entries sum to 8 hours.
