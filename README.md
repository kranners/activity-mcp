# activity-mcp

MCP server for interacting with a number of services, like Slack, Harvest, GitHub, etc.

This is primarily for automating timesheets, however these tools can be used for whatever you'd like.

Possible use-cases include:
- Slack server analysis (which channels are used most/least often, etc).
- Desktop activity summarization, which programs you used when and for how long.
-
